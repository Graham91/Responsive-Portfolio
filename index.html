       <h2>About</h2>
       <hr>
       <p>I am a creator. I have a bachelors in studio art. Unlike the typical studio art student I spent the majority of college career studing and using the many relevant technologies. I love CNC machining,3d printing, 3d modeling and 3D scanning. They allow me to take my natural gifts and implement them in exciting new ways. In my first sculpture class we learned how to carve stone. 20 hours of hitting a rock with a stick pushed me into the arms of technology, starting a love affair that I just coudln't shake. I had no reason to code at this time, but I knew if something could be done better or easier, I wasn't about to waste my time doing it the long way. 
       </p><p>in the more recent past I took a job as a production analyst with a company called Geomni. At the time they were building 3d models of peoples homes using aeiral imagery. the modeling aspect combined with the fact that my wife worked in the building made this job ideal. What I didnt know when i took the job is that it would introduce me to a whole new world of tools.
       </p><p> I have an extremely analitical mind with a knack for detail. I quickly became recognized for my ablitity to find workarounds and find solutions to buggy programing, on a surface level of course. I was move to the PA testing department which was like a less knowledgable QA position. It was here were I got to interact with developers and find out what ws happening behind the scenes. I realized that while the testing department had more information that the rest of the PA's it was still in the dark about most things. developers were talked about in reverent tones like they were gods or something. I decided i simply couldn't stand for it and my idea for indepth comprehsive documentation of how the system worked was born. My intent was to give the testers enough information that they would be better able to pinpoint a problem after running a few test. My team lead agreed it would be a benificial project, so I began. I started looking thorugh confusing flow charts and reaching out to different departments to compile the documentation.
       </p><p> It was fun and Although I was getting praised left and right for this initiative, to get our highly skilled group of production analyst out of the dark absis of program ingorance, I had a secret.  I'm going to let you in on it; even though I had everyone convinced that I was just this heroic documentor, I had another selfish purpose entirely. I have this sort of insatiable desire to understand things. I just wanted to know how it worked, because I was curious. 
    </p><p>     Well about a month add a half in, our company got hit with a pretty serious patent infridgement halting all our production, and I got layed off with about 40 of my coworkers. So it was time to reevalute but unlike when I started school, a decade before, I knew something I didn't back then. Coding was no longer this ambigous monster the nerds lorded over me, bless them. Please don't think I'm prejuduce, I just had the opertunity to grow up in the shadow of a brother who was scary smart, but thanks to that job though, I now know that scary was just unknown. Coding had been demystified. As the pieces of my interests began to fall into place for me, I realized that What I had been chasing at my job was a developers undestanding. So as soon as I could I signed up for a bootcamp and got started. </p>
    <p>
 Turns out coding is a ton of fun. I welcome the added ablitity to create and streamline the things I value. If michelangelo or da vinci were alive today, you can bet your socks, they would not be hitting rocks with sticks and mixing colors on a palete. Fingers in the dirt are for enjoying a sandy beach and picking carrots not for doing things the hard way. Life should be easy and it should only get easier.</p>
